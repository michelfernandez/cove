for electronic signing
===============
Each e-signature must be uniquely attributable to one person.
Therefore, Skribble requires the identification of the signatories.
The procedures differ depending on the application.

# Contracts without written form
The advanced electronic signature (AES) is typically used for contracts
without formal requirements. With AES, the law requires that the identity
of the signatory can be reconstructed afterwards.

Companies that record the identity of their employees by default can activate AES via the company e-mail address. Anyone with a corresponding e-mail address can sign with AES immediately.

Swiss telecom providers are obliged to record the ID or passport of their customers before signing a contract. Anyone registering on Skribble with a Swiss mobile phone number can sign immediately with AES.

## Contracts requiring the written form
For contracts requiring the written form, the qualified electronic signature (QES) is typically used. With QES, the law requires that the identity of the signatory be verified in advance in personal contact.

You perform the identifications yourself.

Appropriate if new QES signers are constantly being added.

A growing number of people in Europe have a verified electronic identity (eID). Skribble integrates these eIDs. This means that millions of people can sign immediately with QES or AES without additional identification procedures.

{{% collapsible 10 "When do I use which signature standard?" %}}
The simple electronic signature (SES) and the advanced electronic signature (AES) are legally valid for all contracts for which the law does not prescribe a specific form (contracts without the written form). You use the qualified electronic signature (QES) for contracts with a written requirement or to meet internal compliance requirements. You can find examples and more information at: https://www.skribble.com/signaturestandards/
{{% /collapsible %}}

{{% collapsible 11 "Which identification measures are required for the simple electronic signature (SES)?" %}}
With SES, the e-mail address serves as an identification element. The e-mail address must be confirmed by clicking on a link that is sent to the corresponding e-mail address.
{{% /collapsible %}}

{{% collapsible 12 "Why is identification different for SES, AES and QES?" %}}
The legal identification requirements are not the same. QES is the highest standard and is equivalent to a handwritten signature. The identification requirements for QES are precisely defined in the law. With SES and AES, providers have more freedom. When selecting identification procedures for SES and AES, Skribble pays attention to simplicity of use and maximisation of legal weight.

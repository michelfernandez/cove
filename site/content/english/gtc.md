2. The duration of the subscription results from the Customer Contract.
3. Unless otherwise agreed in the Customer Contract, the duration of the subscription shall be automatically extended by further consecutive periods corresponding to the original subscription (e.g., if the Customer has an annual plan, the subscription shall be extended by a further 12 months; if the Customer has a monthly plan, the subscription shall be extended by a further month). The contract can be terminated at the end of a subscription period or at the time agreed in the Customer Contract.

    1. with immediate effect, in accordance with the provisions of Section I.1.5.;
    2. one the date in accordance with Clause G.1.4. if the Customer exercises his special right of termination in the event of increases in remuneration unilaterally declared by Skribble;
    3. on the date pursuant to Section J.2.2. if the Customer exercises the special right of termination in the event of amendments to the GTC pursuant to Section J.2.2.;
    4. with immediate effect if a certification authority terminates its contractual relationship with Skribble or fails to perform its services, and Skribble is thereby unable to perform its services under the Customer Contract and/or to perform its services in full; in this case, Skribble has the alternative of temporarily interrupting the provision of the service after notifying the customer thereof.
5. Skribble may terminate this contract at any time with immediate effect or interrupt the provision of the service after notifying the Customer if the Customer or his System Users have violated essential provisions of the Customer Contract and this violation either cannot be remedied or has not been remedied within a period of 10 days upon request. If the Customer is in default with the payment of remuneration, this shall be deemed a breach of a material provision of the Customer Contract.

### Suspension of the contractual relationship or of the access to the Skribble Service
1. Skribble is entitled to suspend or to restrict the access of System Users to the Skribble Service:
    1. if the Customer is in default with the payment obligations;
    2. if System Users of the Customer repeatedly violate the Customer Contract or the Terms of Use, in            particular the provisions in Section G.2. of these GTC, insofar as Skribble has informed the Customer of      the possibility of suspension in the event of repetition;
    3. if the undisturbed operation of the Skribble Service is endangered due to circumstances within the Customer's sphere of control.

## J - Miscellaneous
{{% /markdown %}}
{{% markdown legal %}}
### Liability
1. Skribble shall be liable for all contractual, quasi-contractual and statutory claims, including claims in tort, for damages and reimbursement of expenses in accordance with the provisions in clauses J.1.2. - J.1.3. Any other liability of Skribble shall be excluded.
2. Skribble shall be liable without limitation on any legal grounds whatsoever
    1. in case of intent or gross negligence,
    2. in the event of negligent or intentional injury to life, limb, or health,
    3. due to mandatory liability such as under the Product Liability Act.
3. If Skribble negligently violates an essential contractual obligation, the liability shall be limited to the foreseeable damage typical for the contract, unless unlimited liability is assumed in accordance with Clause J.1.2. Essential contractual obligations are, for example, obligations for the fulfilment of which is essential for the proper execution of the contract and on the observance of which the Customer may regularly rely. Essential contractual obligations are then those which the contract imposes on Skribble with the aim of precisely favouring the achievement of the purpose of the contract.
4. The above liability provisions shall also apply with regard to the liability of Skribble for its vicarious agents and legal representatives.
5. Skribble is neither a provider of certification services nor a certification authority within the meaning of the Federal Electronic Signature Act (ZertES). Nor is Skribble a (qualified) trust service provider within the meaning of the Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market (eIDAS No. 910/2014). Skribble therefore excludes any liability for damages caused mainly or exclusively in connection with the services of the certification service provider or the certification authority.
6. Skribble is not a provider of electronic identities. Skribble therefore excludes all liability for damage caused mainly or exclusively in connection with the services provided by the provider of electronic identities.
7. Skribble then excludes any liability for damages caused mainly or exclusively by the Customer, such as damages due to incompatibility of the end devices used by the user with the system operated by Skribble, interruption of data transmission from the provider of the user to the System User, deactivation of necessary cookies or damages resulting from lack of access security on the part of the user.
8. In the event of malfunctions or system failures, Skribble will endeavour to remedy these as quickly as possible. Skribble excludes any liability for damages which might occur to the user due to lack of availability of the Skribble Service.
9. Liability for loss of data is limited to the typical effort required to restore the data if backup copies are made regularly and in accordance with the associated risks.
10. Insofar as Skribble makes third-party services accessible within the framework of Skribble Service (e.g. certification service provider/registration authority), their availability and the quality requirements for such third-party services shall be governed by the provisions applicable to the respective third-party services. In no case is Skribble liable for disturbances, minor quality and/or interruptions concerning such third-party services.

### Amendments
1. Skribble reserves the right to periodically review these GTC and, if necessary, to amend them at any time and to adapt its services to the new state of the art. Skribble will inform the Customer of these changes in a suitable form (e.g. in writing, by e-mail and/or online at the next login in the Client Account). Skribble shall inform the Customer of the date on which the Customer Contract with the amended GTC continues to apply. Changes to the contract initiated by the Customer will not be made as long as Skribble has not given its formal written consent.
2. If amendments to the GTC substantially worsen the legal relationship between the Customer and Skribble, the Customer has the right to terminate the Customer Contract at the point in time at which the amendment to the GTC becomes effective according to Skribble's notification, provided that the Customer declares this in writing to Skribble within 14 days of receipt of the notification.
3. Otherwise, the Customer agreement can only be amended in writing with the mutual consent of both parties.

### Transfer of Rights
1. The Customer may only transfer the rights and obligations arising from this agreement to third parties with the prior written consent of Skribble.

### Severability
1. Should individual provisions or parts of these GTC prove to be void or ineffective or incomplete, this shall not affect the validity of the remaining legal relationship based on these GTC. The invalidity and/or incompleteness of one provision shall not affect the validity of the other provisions.
2. The invalid, ineffective and/or incomplete provision shall be replaced by a legally valid replacement provision which comes as close as possible to the invalid or incomplete provision.

### Place of Jurisdiction
1. If the Customer Contract was concluded with Skribble AG in accordance with Clause A.1.2., the following shall apply:
    1. The legal relationship between the Customer and Skribble existing under these GTC is subject to Swiss law, to the exclusion of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods of 11      April 1980.
    2. The exclusive place of jurisdiction for all disputes relating to these GTC is Zurich, Switzerland. However, Skribble is entitled in any case to appeal to the court at the Customer's place of business.
2. If the Customer Contract was concluded with Skribble Deutschland GmbH in accordance with Clause A.1.2., the following shall apply:
    1. The legal relationship between the Customer and Skribble existing under these GTC is subject to German law, to the exclusion of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods of 11      April 1980.

## The typewriter became Microsoft Word, the CD turned into Spotify, the DVD became Netflix.

Digitalisation makes many things faster, cheaper and simpler. This also applies to 90 percent of day to day business processes.

The remaining ten percent require a high degree of trust, for example signing employment contracts. Many companies still rely on established analogue processes for this. Because making their digital equivalent compliant with all legal requirements requires an enormous additional expenditure. At least up to now.

## Skribble wants to change this:

Contracts should no longer have to take a detour via the printer and paper in order to be signed:

With Skribble signature processes are 100% digital, based on legally regulated standards, including the qualified electronic signature (QES) - the only form of electronic signature that is equivalent to a handwritten signature before Swiss and EU law.

Security does not come at the expense of simplicity: every company, regardless of size and technical know-how, should be able to benefit from the advantages of this digital transformation.

## And that's just the beginning:
Building trust in digital business relationships should become as simple and intuitive as toasting bread. In 2018 we formed a team of Trust Shapers that has been working towards this future.
